Things to work on still
-------

1. Pick better colors. Try to pick and use hex color values like #cccccc [more](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_colors.asp) 
I changed the yellow and purple header but there is still alot that could be done.

2. The internal links now do nothing I would just delete tem and make a page for head units, speakers, and subwoofers.

3. learn how to make a [boostrap nav](http://getbootstrap.com/components/#navbar) and put one in.

Things I changed
------

1. Changed a few colors because they burned my eyes.

2. Added external style sheets and added a bit of my own code. 

3. Added [boostrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) learn about it, its awesome. Not sure if my dad will let u use it.

4. Added some javascipt code and jquery but I made it non functional. I decided that was a bit much for your level.


There are prob a bunch of spelling mistakes in this, I am a coder not an English major.
